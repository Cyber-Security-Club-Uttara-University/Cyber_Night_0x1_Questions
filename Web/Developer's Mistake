### 🎉 Welcome

Welcome to the [Cyber Security Club at Uttara University!](https://cybersecurity.club.uttara.ac.bd) 
A new feature was supposed to greet users with a friendly message when they visited the site… but it mysteriously vanished from the resource locator.

One of our developers, [Pritom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pran0x/), may have made a mistake while implementing it.Your mission is to inspect the site, uncover why the greeting message isn't appearing for new visitors, and report it as a bug.
