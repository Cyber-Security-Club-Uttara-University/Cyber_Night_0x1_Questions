**Points:** 150  

---

### 🧩 Challenge Description

During the international takedown of Nulled.to, a prominent darknet marketplace and hacking forum, investigators uncovered fragmented clues about one of its key staff members. This individual operated under an alias, but whispers in underground circles suggest they had a passion for the Joker character and were deeply involved in digital art as their primary job.

Your mission is to track down the identity or alias of this staff member before their digital footprint vanishes.
