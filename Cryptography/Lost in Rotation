## 🔄 Lost in Rotation  
**Points:** 150

### 📜 Challenge Description

The text of an old book has been found, but it is utterly jumbled! According to scholars, it was encoded using a rotational cipher that is far more complex than ROT13 or even ROT47.

They believe the rotation encompasses a far wider range of characters and isn't just restricted to regular ASCII. Can you figure out what the text's hidden message is?
